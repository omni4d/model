# A problem of recursion arises: How do we make a tuple a member of the
# class_member_tuples class? If we use a class_member tuple to do so,  how do we
# make that tuple a member of the class_members class?

# A similar issue arises when we attempt to show that the part_subpart_tuples
# class has a part_subpart relationship with class_of_tuples.

# One solution would be to create subtypes of tuple and insist that all tuple
# signs must of one of those subtypes rather than the base type; effectively
# embedding the meaning we desire within the type system.

# Instead, we make two assertions and embed the meaning we desire within
# those assertions:

# 1) Any tuple whose member objects have roles entitled 'member' and 'class' is
# itself a member of the class_member_tuples class

# 2) The tuple that links part_subpart_tuples and class_of_tuples indicates that
# former is a subpart of the latter.

# The tuple referred to in the second assertion:
